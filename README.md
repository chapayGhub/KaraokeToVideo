# KaraokeToMp4
macOS sample code that converts mp3+cdg to mp4
======

Project to learn a bit about Apple's media APIs.  

**KaraokeLib**

Library to handle converting MP3+CDG files into an MP4.  It's not very fast.  Takes my macBook Pro about 30s.

**KaraokeToVideo**

The command line tool converts a MP3+CDG files into an MP4.

**KaraokeToVideoGUI**

Placeholder for a GUI.  I'm pretty lazy these days might not get to this.
